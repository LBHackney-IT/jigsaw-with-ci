# Create React App example

An example of how to use the Hackney design system with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).

It uses a Sass stylesheet, as documented [here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-sass-stylesheet/).

## Installation

You need Node.js and yarn installed.

```
yarn install
npm start
```

It will be on `localhost:3000`

To make the API calls you will need the https://github.com/LBHackney-IT/single-view-api-prototype repo, running on port 3001.
